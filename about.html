        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>I have several years of experience in IT, mainly as Ops, and more recently in the role of Cloud Engineer in the CRM software sector.

        <p>Currently, I'm working on the automation and implementation of a monitoring solution based on the AppDynamics system. I am also involved in several different projects that include designing and deploying backend infrastructure on AWS. I do this by using technologies like Jenkins, Terraform, Kubernetes. I'm also familiar with products such as Aviatrix, CloudRanger, Opsgenie, or Gitlab.

        <p>I'm a big fan of cloud solutions, strongly oriented towards Amazon Web Services (AWS). I like what I am doing. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. I do not know everything for sure, but I consider myself addicted to learning new things.

        <p>I work fully remote since before it was a "thing", and I am not interested in office-based roles.
