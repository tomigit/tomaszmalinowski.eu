            <li>Born in Poland, father of two incredible kids, husband of a beautiful wife. At this moment living in the UK but who knows what will come next...</li>

        <ul>
            <li>My "real" IT adventure started around 2002, when I connected my home (and a few others in the area) to the super fast broadband with guaranteed speed of 115kbps! Since then I was working as system administrator, helpdesk guy, NOC Engineer, Ops, DevOps. I wore many different hats in last few years, mainly as Ops, and more recently in the role of <b>Cloud Engineer</b> in the CRM software sector.</li>
            <li>Currently, I'm working on the automation and implementation of a monitoring solution based on the AppDynamics system. I am also involved in several different projects that include designing and deploying backend infrastructure on AWS. I do this by using technologies like Jenkins, Terraform, Kubernetes. I'm also familiar with products such as Aviatrix, CloudRanger, Opsgenie, or Gitlab.</li>
            <li>I'm a big fan of cloud solutions, strongly oriented towards Amazon Web Services (AWS). I like what I am doing. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. I do not know everything for sure, but I consider myself addicted to learning new things.</li>
            <li>I work fully remote since before it was a "thing", and I am not interested in office-based roles.</li>
